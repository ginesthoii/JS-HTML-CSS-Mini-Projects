# JS-HTML-CSS-Mini-Projects

A growing collection of small, self-contained JavaScript, HTML, CSS projects.  
Each project lives in its own folder with its own `index.html`, `style.css`, and `index.js`, so you can run them directly in your browser.

- Choose from available browser voices  
- Adjust speed, pitch, and volume  
- Preview button to quickly sample selected voice  
- Pause, Stop, and Speak controls

3. Type your text, pick a voice, and press Speak.  

Note: Works best in Chrome or Edge (voice support varies by browser).  



### Tech Used
